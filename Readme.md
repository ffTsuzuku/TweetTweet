# 6.005 Problem Set 1 Tweet Tweet

This is a TypeScript rewrite of the source code used for ps1 in
[MIT's OCW 6.005](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/psets/ps1/index.html)

The intent of this code base is only to practice my TypeScript and allows others
to attempt the problem set in a language other than Java.

Note this project includes a data set of tweets. The tweets are sourced from
a research paper titled You Are Where You Tweet, which is cited below. The data
set included in this project is a subset of the data from that paper.
Furthermore the included dataset modifies by original dataset by adding
fictitious names to the tweets so that they may have first and last names which
is requires as per the spec of the Tweet class used within this project. The
names are randomly generated using a library I created called MBFactory which
is also cited below.

Eventually a branch titled Solution will be uploaded which shows one
possible solution to this problem set.

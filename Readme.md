# 6.005 Problem Set 1 Tweet Tweet

This is a TypeScript rewrite of the source code used for ps1 in
[MIT's OCW 6.005](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/psets/ps1/index.html)

The intent of this code base is to allows others to attempt the problem set in
a language other than Java.

Note this project includes a data set of tweets, which were fetched from the api
endpoint used in the ps1 code, this is to ensure that if the endpoint is ever
removed a backup set of tweets is available.

A solution for this Problem Set can be found under the Solution branch.
